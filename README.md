Simple Notes App

A lightweight, file-based note-taking application built with Node.js and Express. 
This project provides a simple interface to **create**, **view**, and **delete** plain text notes, using the local filesystem as a storage mechanism. 
It's ideal for learning server-side rendering with EJS and practicing file I/O operations in Node.js.
